# Exercise 2 - JMS routing

JMS has been part of the java standard for years now and is used a lot.
That is why it is an integral part of Camel just as File and FTP. 
This exercise will show how easy it is to get messaging working...

* Check out branch ex3 (`git checkout ex3`)
* Open class `SimpleJmsRoute`
* Follow the instructions there and make it all work...

## Bonus material 

* In this case both spring-boot and camel make a lot of magic happen.

## Hint(s)

* jms component
* maven artifact
