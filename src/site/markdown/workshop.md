# Workshop

## Introduction

This workshop has a couple of goals:

* Why would or should you want to use Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)
* Familiarize yourself with the ease of integration with Camel
* Have some exercise with the framework
* Get the plumbing code to get started for free :-)

## How

This site will walk you through a couple of routes to get familiarize yourself with the Camel framework.
The exercises will be explained below and what is expected. The exercises will start out easy and will progressively get more 
difficult. We will go into the Enterprise Integration Patterns and will also implement some of them.

Hope you like the experience and love the ease with which you can now integrate different technologies and protocols.
